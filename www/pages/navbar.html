Currently, the Anna Medical College is affiliated with the University of Technology, Mauritius, with the latter as the awarding body for the MBBS programme which was revised in 2017 from a 4.5 year to a 5 year programme.  The entry requirements for the MBBS programme are in line with those prescribed by the Medical Council of Mauritius for an MBBS programme to be a recognized medical qualification for registration as medical practitioner.  A first batch of UTM awardees who completed postgraduate medical studies under the ex Padmashree Dr D. Y. Patil Medical College and UTM have successfully registered with the Medical Council of Mauritius as Medical Specialists.  UTM MBBS Graduates who completed their studies under Anna Medical College have also undertaken pre-registration examinations prescribed by the Medical Council of Mauritius qualifying them for internship.
