            <h2>Programme Information</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The BSc (Hons) Software Engineering is designed to satisfy the increasing demand for well trained graduates to work in the
                export-oriented software development industry. The curriculum provides a balanced and intellectually stimulating
                programme which combines together state-of-art techniques and emerging trends to produce skilled software engineers.
                The programme introduces students to the necessary foundations in computing and mathematical techniques. Following
                which, software engineering knowledge and skills are developed with modules such as programming, databases, web
                development and systems analysis and design. More specific technical skills and emerging techniques are further introduced
                with Web Services, Mobile computing and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The programme also prepares the
                students for research, management, communication, entrepreneurship and legal aspects through interactive seminars.
                Work placement attached with the software development industry is an integral part of this course and allows students to
                gain practical work experience during the final semester of the third year</p>
